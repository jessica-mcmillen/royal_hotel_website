        <div class="title">GENERAL BOOKING TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div><br>
        <div class="main-text"><b>Area of applicability</b> <br>1. These general terms and conditions apply for all services and deliveries by the hotel. <br>2. Should the hotel change its general terms and conditions before the termination of the contract, the updated version
            is incorporated into the contract if the partner to the contract is informed about this in writing with reference to these legal consequences and the partner does not object to the incorporation within a period of 14 days.<br> 3. The customer’s
            general terms and conditions shall only form part of this contract if the hotel consents in writing to the incorporation in whole or for individually specified points.<br><br> <b>Conclusion of the contract</b> <br>1. The contract (hereafter
            also referred to as the “booking”) comes into effect on request from the customer through the acceptance by the hotel. The hotel is free to confirm the booking in writing.<br> 2. If a third party makes the booking for the customer, it is liable
            to the hotel as the booking party together with the customer as joint debtor.<br><br>
            <b>Services, prices, payment, billing</b><br> 1. The hotel is obligated to perform the services ordered by the customer and agreed to by the hotel.
            <br> 2. The customer is obligated to pay the hotel the agreed prices for these and other services enlisted. This also applies for hotel services and expenses induced by it for third parties.
            <br> 3. If the hotel rescinds with good cause, the customer has no claim for compensation.
            <br> 4. The agreed prices include the current statutory VAT. Should the rate of VAT applicable to the contractual services increase or decrease after the conclusion of the contract, the prices shall be adjusted accordingly.
            <br> 5. If the period between the conclusion of the contract and the fulfilment of the contract as defined by the contractual agreements exceeds four months and the general price charged for such services is increased by the hotel, this can
            increase the contractually agreed price as appropriate, but by 5 % at the most.
            <br> 6. The hotel is entitled to increase the prices if municipal duties (culture tax, visitor’s tax, etc.) for the accommodation are increased. The price increase is limited to the costs of the abovementioned duties.
            <br> 7. The hotel’s bills are payable immediately upon receipt of the bill without any deduction, unless other payment terms and conditions are expressly agreed. The hotel is entitled to render accumulated claims for payment at any time and
            to demand Immediate payment. If payment is delayed, the hotel is entitled to claim interest t for delay amounting to 10% above the base rate for companies and 5% above the base rate for consumers. The hotel is at liberty to prove that the
            damages are greater.
            <br> 8. The subleasing and re-leasing of allocated rooms, other rooms, spaces or cabinets as well as inviting to interviews, sales or similar events require the prior written consent of the hotel.
            <br> 9. The hotel is entitled to demand upon conclusion of the contract an appropriate advance payment or security deposit in the form of a credit card guarantee or similar from the customer. If an advance payment is not made within the agreed
            period, the hotel can withdraw from the contract and claim compensation for damages.
            <br> 10. In justified cases (e.g. outstanding payment by the customer or extending the scope of the contract) the hotel is entitled to demand an increase of the advance payment agreed in the contract or an increased security deposit amounting
            to the expected costs of the accommodation.
            <br> 11. The hotel is further entitled to demand an appropriate advance payment or a security deposit from the customer at the beginning and during the customer’s stay, provided that such an advance paym ent or security deposit was not already
            paid in accordance with the above provisions.
            <br> 12. The customer can only settle or lower a claim by the hotel with an undisputed or valid claim.<br><br>
            <b>Room availability, delivery and return</b><br> 1. The customer does not acquire any claim for the availability of a particular room, unless the hotel confirmed the availability of a particular room in writing.
            <br>2. Booked rooms are available to the customer from 15:00 on the day of arrival. The customer has no claim for earlier availability. Guests who arrive before 15:00 can move into their room as early as possible, according to availability.
            <br>3. The available rooms are to be taken by 18:30 on the day of arrival. After this time the hotel can book out the rooms to others, unless the customer informed the hotel in advance and in writing that they would arrive later. The hotel
            is entitled to demand a guarantee for late arrivals.
            <br>4. On the agreed day of departure, check-out is at 11:00 at the latest. After that time the hotel can charge 50 % of the agreed price of the room for the additional use of the room up until 18:00, and 100 % from 18:00. Possible further
            claims for compensation for damages by the hotel are reserved. Please see the Group Booking Information below.<br><br></div>
